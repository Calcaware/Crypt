# Crypt
The simplest encryption algorithm I could think of.
I made it for fun one night.
I didn't put too much thought into it.
Feel free to use this if you don't care that much about security, but want to have fun encrypting your stuff.
By using this software you agree that I am not responsible for any data loss you may experience.
Have fun. :)
